basic webscraper in Ruby, scraping jobs from indeed.com


Just a quick little practice webscraper made with Ruby, using HTTParty and Nokogiri.

Practiced using indeed.com searching for software engineering jobs in Brooklyn, NY.

Eventually will build into quick webapp to email new jobs everyday from multiple job boards based on different search parameters.
